Live Project for Utility Construction

I collaborated on a bootcamp live project to create a new website for Utility Construction, including wire-framing, prototyping, and coding the portfolio page as well as designing a new logo. This live project was designed to simulate a real working environment as closely as possible, using the Agile project management methodology and the Scrum framework. There were two week-long sprints, each with daily standups, assigned deliverables, and a retrospective. The first week focused on design, and the second on development. You can read much more about the process [here](https://www.robcorpuz.design/project/balancing-tradition-and-innovation-in-a-construction-website-design).

Here is the code I was responsible for:
